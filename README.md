# Solving_Overfitting_Using_Dropouts

 This code repository demonstrates the process of creating an artificial dataset for binary classification and regression. 
 It showcases how overfitting can occur when training a model on the dataset. To mitigate overfitting, we 
 implement dropout layers in the deep learning model using keras. Dropout helps prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating 
 neurons during training. This simple project highlights the importance of regularization techniques in improving model generalization.

Recommended value of "p" some architecture
 
      CNN, p = 0.4 to 0.5
      RNN, p = 0.2 to 0.3
      ANN, p = 0.2 to 0.5
